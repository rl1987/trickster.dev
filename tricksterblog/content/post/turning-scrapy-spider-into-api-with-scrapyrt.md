Scrapy framework provides many benefits over regular Python scripts when it comes
to developing web scrapers of non-trivial complexity. However Scrapy by itself does
provide a direct way to integrate your web scraper into larger system that may need
some on-demand scraping (e.g. price comparison website). 
[ScrapyRT](https://github.com/scrapinghub/scrapyrt) is a Scrapy extension
that was developed by Zyte to address this limitation. Just like Scrapy itself,
it is trivially installable through PIP. ScrapyRT exposes your Scrapy project
(not just spiders, but also pipelines, middlewares and extensions) through
HTTP API that you can integrate into your systems.

To show how ScrapyRT can be used, we are going to rely on 
[`books_to_scrape`](https://github.com/rl1987/trickster.dev-code/tree/main/2022-02-13-introduction-to-scrapy-framework/books_to_scrape)
Scrapy project that was developed to demonstrate Scrapy project development.

Launching ScrapyRT entails running a single command in Scrapy project root
directory:

```
$ cd books_to_scrape/
$ scrapyrt
2022-06-04 10:33:17+0200 [-] Log opened.
2022-06-04 10:33:17+0200 [-] Site starting on 9080
2022-06-04 10:33:17+0200 [-] Starting factory <twisted.web.server.Site object at 0x10aa7fa90>
2022-06-04 10:33:17+0200 [-] Running with reactor: SelectReactor. 
```

By default it binds the socket to local host interface. This will make it reachable
by software running on your local machine, but not by external clients that we may
want to expose the API to. Easy fix is to make it bind to wildcard IP address (0.0.0.0)
by providing the `--ip` command line argument:

```
$ scrapyrt --ip 0.0.0.0
```

Running ScrapyRT like this make it accessible through all IP addresses the IP
host can accept incoming traffic at.

Now let us use cURL to launch the spider:

```
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/crawl.json?spider_name=books&url=http://books.toscrape.com&callback=parse_categories"
```

We called the API at `/crawl.json` endpoint with arguments for spider name, 
URL to start scraping at and in this case we also need to provide callback
method name. Some seconds later we receive JSON response that can be piped 
into jq(1) or `python3 -m json.tool` for pretty-printing:

```
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/crawl.json?spider_name=books&url=http://books.toscrape.com&callback=parse_categories" | jq

But in the months that followed, it grew into something more for Ken Ilgunas. It became an irresistible adventure—an opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits. So in September 2012, he strapped on his backpack, stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of Denver, and hitchhiked 1,500 miles to the Alberta tar sands. Once there, he turned around and began his 1,700-mile trek to the XL’s endpoint on the Gulf Coast of Texas, a journey he would complete entirely on foot, walking almost exclusively across private property.Both a travel memoir and a reflection on climate change, Trespassing Across America is filled with colorful characters, harrowing physical trials, and strange encounters with the weather, terrain, and animals of America’s plains. A tribute to the Great Plains and the people who live there, Ilgunas’s memoir grapples with difficult questions about our place in the world: What is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land? As members of a rapidly warming planet? As mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry? Ultimately, Trespassing Across America is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not half wild is a life only half lived. ...more",

Not only we got all the scraped items, but we also received some statistics
on scope and duration of the scraping job.

However, we may want to have more fine-grained control over scraping to have
only single page scraped. To achieve this, we need to pass JSON payload to
ScrapyRT API. Let me show how this can be done through Python REPL:

```

As expected, we got a single item with scraped data from page we pointed at in
our request. Some of the arguments we previously passed as URL parameters
are now part of JSON payload. 

One thing we may want to do is to run ScrapyRT in Docker container
to expose Scrapy project through API. Zyte provides an official [ScrapyRT image](https://hub.docker.com/r/scrapinghub/scrapyrt)
that is unfortunately neglected and still uses Python 2.7 at the `latest` tag.
However, it is fairly simple to dockerize ScrapyRT without relying on it.
We can create the following Dockerfile at the same directory that 
has scrapy.cfg file:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3-slim

RUN pip3 install scrapy scrapyrt

RUN mkdir /books_to_scrape
ADD . /books_to_scrape
WORKDIR /books_to_scrape

EXPOSE 9080

ENTRYPOINT ["scrapyrt", "-i", "0.0.0.0"]
```

To learn more about ScrapyRT, see the [official documentation](https://scrapyrt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Key limitation to keep in mind is that ScrapyRT is not designed to support
long crawls. It is meant to be used to help software outside Scrapy to scrape
a single page or small number of pages. This solution effectively turns web
sites into RESTful APIs. However if you need a way to launch large scraping
jobs through REST API you should consider [Scrapyd](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapyd) 
API server that was designed to provide a way to manage scraping jobs from
outside Scrapy framework. To upload and run your Scrapy project in the
cloud you may want to consider either [Scrapy Cloud](https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/)
SaaS solution or [Scrapydweb](https://github.com/my8100/scrapydweb) for 
self-hosted option.
